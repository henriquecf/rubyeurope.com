  description: "Hey there, Ruby friends! 👋<br>Did you know one of our key goals (what we call our “second pillar“) at Ruby Europe is to bring fresh talent into the Ruby world? Yep, we’re all about growing the community by teaching newcomers and convincing seasoned devs to dive into Ruby.<br>
How can we maintain a vibrant community without fresh talent?<br>
At EuRuKo (and later at Rails World, Friendly.rb, and NYC.rb), we shared some ideas. At first, we thought, “These are 2025 plans.”<br>
But why wait? We’re ready to kick things off now, see what’s possible, and we need YOU 🫵  to help make it happen.<br>
Here’s are those ideas where you can jump in:
• Empowering Rails Girls - helping Rails Girls to run more frequently ⭐
• Build connections between bootcamps like Le Wagon and local Ruby groups 🤝
• Build/Join our Ruby Europe Mentorship Program 📗
• Help launch the Ruby Europe Online Academy/Bootcamp 🚀<br>
We’ll be sharing more info about these projects soon. They may seem ambitious, but there are small initial steps that will make a big impact! <br>
Let’s get started together: tag us, message us, and most importantly - refer friends who would be perfect for these roles! 👆<br>
Let’s grow this community together!")
